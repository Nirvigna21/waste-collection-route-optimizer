# Smart Waste Collection Route Optimizer
A Python-based project that optimizes waste collection routes by selecting bins with high fill levels and computing an efficient collection order to minimize travel distance.

## Features
- Filters bins based on fill level
- Uses distance-based greedy algorithm
- Outputs optimized collection order
- Calculates total travel distance

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas`
3. Run: `python main.py`

## Future Enhancements
- Google Maps API integration
- Real-time IoT bin data
